Git-git-git
===========

Excuse the dumb name. This is the space that I'm going to be using to organize my git-talk.

Format
======

This talk will be presented in the course of 40-some minutes and will go a bit, but not too far, in depth.

### Introduction [8 minutes]
    - A story about a version control-less world
    - What is git?
    - Why would I want to use git?
    - What I'm going to tell you.
        - How we're going to break this up (beginner/expert)

### Body (so affectionately named) [20 minutes]
Each of these will broken down into:
    - a new command
    - graph theory view of what it is?
    - what does it do
    - why do I want to use it

### Close out [2 minutes]
    - What I just finished telling you
    - Q&A / Why this is important

### Q&A [10 minutes?]
    - Given an example in git __if easily setup__

Ideas
=====
    - Show what the graph theory looks like (how? Separate image? Whiteboard? 'cat'?)
    - should cover HEAD, also ^ and ~ and .. notation
    - Commands to consider
        - status
        - add
        - commit
            - cover commit hash, ranges, sane messagesj
        - log
        - diff
        - branch
        - push
        - pull
        - fetch
        - checkout
        - stash
        - cherry-pick
        - reset
        - rebase
        - remote / fork <- separate sections
        - reflog
    - should I cover working / stage / repo?

I think I'll split this up into sections:
#### I. Git Basics
- Init
- Clone
- Add
- Status
- Commit
- log

#### II. Warming up
- branch
- stash
- diff
- merge
- checkout
- reset
- cherry-pick

#### IIIIIIIIIII. Working alone, together
- Push
- Pull
- Fetch
- Remote
- forking
- pull requests
